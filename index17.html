                    My name is Krista McNaney and I am a design advocate and double diamond UX/UI designer 
                    with strong visual instincts. My fervent desire is to use my UX/UI skills and my background 
                    in graphics to work with you creating attractive, user-centric designs. 
                    My story starts in Northern Ontario where I was born and raised. The small town I come from 
                    isnâ€™t very far from where Letterkenny is filmed. I made my way down south and graduated from 
                    Niagara College with a degree in Graphic Design.

                    From there my path led me through various print factories, newspapers, 
                    magazines and print shops throughout Ontario. I honed my skills, developed new 
                    ones and gained experience in many different fascets 
                    of the print industry.
                    
                    Always eager to learn a new skill, I decided to curve my career towards user 
                    experience design as UX lets both sides of my brain frolic while I solve puzzles 
                    to help create visually appealing, user-centric designs.
                    
                    So here I am, ready to help you with your UX needs.
