		<h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
	</div>
	<div><p>My name is Krista McNaney and my story starts in Northern Ontario where I was born and raised. The small town I come from isnâ€™t very far from where Letterkenny is filmed. I made my way down south and graduated from Niagara College with a degree in Graphic Design.</p>

	<p>	From there my path led me through various print factories, newspapers, magazines and print shops throughout Ontario. I honed my skills, developed new 
		ones and gained experience in many different fascets 
		of the print industry.</p>
		
		<p>Always eager to learn a new skill, I decided to curve my career towards user experience design as UX lets both sides of my brain frolic while I solve puzzles to help create visually appealing, user-centric designs.</p>
		
		<p>So here I am, ready to help you with your UX needs. </p>
